# Operating workflow rules (per user 2026-07-13)

> L0: 4 operating rules (M-task-summary, M-must-read,
> M-context-snapshot, M-subtask-summary) for how agent should
> work, not what the work is.  Load when ending a task,
> switching tasks, or unsure which tools to use.

## When to use this

Load this doc when:
- Ending a task (M-task-summary).
- Switching tasks (M-context-snapshot).
- Unsure which docs to read first (M-must-read).
- Mid multi-leaf task and need to summarize (M-subtask-summary).

## What these rules are

These are **operating workflow rules** (M-* prefix), not P-n
— they govern how the agent *works*, not what the work *is*.
Full context lives in PRINCIPLES.md (P-n list) and
PRINCIPLES_DETAIL.md (P-n full text).

Per P23 (doc > script with nuance): "Don't write a script
until doc rule has been broken 3+ times" — same applies to
adding new P-n.  These 4 rules are workflow guidance, not
principles, so they live in OPERATING_RULES.md, not
PRINCIPLES.md.

## The 4 rules

### M-task-summary

After every task completion, briefly state what went well
(and what could improve).  Decide whether the project's docs
should be updated based on what you learned; if yes, include
the doc fix in the same task (per P14 docs-stay-current).

### M-must-read

For principles that are needed *every* session (e.g. P5 测通,
P11 摘要+引用, P17 老实说, P22 stuck→plan), surface them in
`AGENTS.md` "Hard rules" above (already done).  **Do NOT**
add to AGENTS.md the full text of every P-n — that bloats
context.  AGENTS.md is a pointer to PRINCIPLES.md, not a
copy (per P11).

### M-context-snapshot

Before switching tasks, capture the current session's state
to a `session_search`-able artifact (or to a brief note).
On return, load the snapshot to restore context.  **Don't**
try to keep all context in the live conversation — overflow
silently breaks the agent.  Implementation details
(snapshot format, restore mechanism) are TODO (see todo
list, task 8).

Snapshot location convention:
`C:\Users\LQ\AppData\Local\Temp\hermes-snapshot-<topic>-<date>.md`
(session_search-able by title).  NOT in repo unless user
asks (Temp gets cleared on session restart, so don't rely
on long-term).

### M-subtask-summary

For multi-leaf tasks, each leaf commit should include a
1-2 line summary in its commit message body.  When the agent
returns for the integration step (5-step loop step 5), it
should NOT need to re-read every leaf's diff — the summaries
suffice.

## Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)

- **Don't** skip M-task-summary at task end (lose
  meta-learning).
- **Don't** duplicate P-n full text in AGENTS.md (violates
  M-must-read + bloat).
- **Don't** try to keep all context in live conversation
  (silent overflow risk).
- **Don't** skip M-subtask-summary in multi-leaf tasks
  (integration step will need to re-read every diff).

  a follow-up commit (it should be a 1-line pointer, not the
  full text).
- PRINCIPLES.md P11 (摘要+引用) — the principle that keeps
  AGENTS.md short.
- PRINCIPLES.md P14 (docs stay current) — the principle that
  M-task-summary operationalizes.
- PRINCIPLES.md P17 (honest reporting) — the principle that
  M-task-summary's "what could improve" enforces.
- docs/COMMON_PITFALLS.md — context-switching pitfalls
  (related but distinct from this doc).
